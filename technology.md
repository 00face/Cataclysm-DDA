# Technology in the Cataclysm

**Summary**:

Technology in Cataclysm should, except in specific situations, be *at a modern real life level*.  The design rationale for this is simple: it allows straightforward answers to questions about things like "is this idea reasonable", "how much ____ should this do", and more.  If it is possible in real life (and you can prove it), it's probably appropriate for Cataclysm.

See [the timeline](./lore-background.md) for lore explanations of the divergent technology in this world.

## Civilian Tech
In terms of civilian technology there are a handful of things that differ from our world.  All of these are very rare and expensive.

### Cybernetics
CBMs have been available to the public for four years at the time of the Cataclysm.  This is vaguely analogous in scope to how common smartphones were in 1998-2002: while they exist, they are too expensive and too hard to find support for to be even somewhat widespread among civilians.

### Robots
Proto-AI evolved from dimensional heuristics (the secrets of which are completely black box and explained away as a kind of deep learning) has made civilian level robots conceivable, albeit extremely rare.  The first public release of robots was police eyebots six years before the Cataclysm.  Most non-police civilian level applications are medical.  These AIs do well in constrained environments with very specific tasks.

### Energy Storage
Energy storage among civilians is basically the same as real life earth, with a couple exceptions:
- electrolytic hydrogen fuel cells are moderately more efficient, thanks to an early introduction of transdimensional tech.
- Li-ion batteries are no better, but are a bit cheaper and more common
-
