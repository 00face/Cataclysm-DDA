Cataclysm Mod
============
Yet Another Darkling Wolf Cataclysm Mod (YADWCM)

I follow a very simple principle when modding, if I find something fun, and it's within my power to add it, I add it. So this mod, as usual, won't follow any strict theme or set of goals. I could be working on making trees more realistic and suddenly shear off into adding blacksmithing.

Pull requests for new features or bugfixes are welcome, although I may already have fixes in my offline repo, so check first.

To make suggestions, check out my thread over on the Cataclysm forums at: http://whalesdev.com/forums/index.php?topic=1389.0

Bugs can be reported in my thread, or brought up with Github's issue tracker. Please try and ensure the bug is actually caused by my mod and is not an issue in Vanilla Cataclysm.
