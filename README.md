Cataclysm Mod
============
Yet Another Darkling Wolf Cataclysm Mod (YADWCM)
I follow a very simple principle when modding, if I find something fun, and it's within my power to add it, I add it. So this mod, as usual, won't follow any strict theme or set of goals. I could be working on making trees more realistic and suddenly shear off into adding blacksmithing.
Pull requests for new features or bugfixes are welcome, although I may already have fixes in my offline repo, so check first.

To report bugs or make suggestions, check out my thread over on the Cataclysm forums at: http://whalesdev.com/forums/index.php?topic=1389.0
